If you have having difficulty viewing Gopherspace, your client might be
broken or not current with current Gopher practise. Many web browsers
make inadequate gopher clients; see our related document on this topic:

	gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/0/gopher/wbgopher

Signs of a broken implementation include 1) not showing all selectors on
a menu; 2) not showing informational text at all; or 3) incorrectly
rendering informational text as links, which invariably fail.

** IF YOUR BROWSER RENDERS GOPHER CORRECTLY, you should have seen a
   title blurb before the link for this document explaining about
   gopher.floodgap.com, and it should not have been a link. **

To see a reference implementation in action, or if you are unlucky enough
to use a browser that does not support Gopher at all (MSIE 6, Opera, Safari,
etc.), you can visit the Floodgap Public Gopher Proxy here to view gopher
sites translated into HTML:
